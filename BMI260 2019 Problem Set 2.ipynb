Iterate through the full mammogram and extract overlapping chunks (similar to what you would do when computing a 2D convolution), then compute the GLCM of each chunk. From each GLCM, compute your favorite Haralick texture feature and save it to a separate matrix. If you've done this correctly, you should be able to produce a textural feature map that is about the same size as your image. Plot this texture map alongside the original image. Does it look like what you expect? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips:**\n",
    "1. This could take really long ~ > 10 mins. If your code is taking too long to run, try downsampling the mammogram to a more reasonable size.\n",
    "2. Don't worry too much about how the kernel behaves near the edges of the image, since these image regions are generally not as important.\n",
    "3. You can choose whatever offsets you'd like when computing the GLCM. It is typical for researchers to make their textural features rotation-invariant by averaging features from multiple GLCMs computed using offsets oriented in all directions, and you can choose to do this if you want.\n",
    "4. Explore different kernel sizes!"
